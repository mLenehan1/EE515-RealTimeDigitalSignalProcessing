\subsection{Part c}

The computation times for each path, with no delay, are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Loop 1: 1 Multiplication, 2 Additions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $2+(2*1)=4$
	\end{itemize}
	\item Loop 2: 2 Multiplications, 3 Additions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $(2*2)+(3*1)=7$
	\end{itemize}
	\item Loop 3: 1 Multiplication, 3 Additions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $2+(3*1)=5$
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Therefore, the critical path is found in the path labelled ``Path 2'' in
Figure \ref{fig:images-DFGLoop}. This path has a length of 7 time units.
