\subsection{Machine Learning Techniques}

Recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of machine learning techniques in
coherent optical receiver systems\cite{kMeans_2019}\cite{nn_2020}. These
techniques have been shown to give possible gain increases of approximately
2dB\cite{kMeans_2019}, or can be used for signal recovery\cite{nn_2020}.
