\subsection{Coherent Detection and DSP}

With the increased usage of coherent detection within optical communications
systems, it has become necessary for DSP techniques to be implemented in order
to correct for transmissions errors due to the high data rates. DSP algorithms
have allowed for higher order modulation techniques than those which were
previously utilised (as discussed within the section on probabilistic shaping).
These algorithms can also allow for lower overhead within the systems, as they
can be used to mitigate the effects of, for example, chromatic dispersion,
allowing for the removal of dedicated optical dispersion compensation units from
the signal chain of the receiver\cite{100Gbaud_2019}.
