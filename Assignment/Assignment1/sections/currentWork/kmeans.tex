\subsection{ML for 16-QAM Demodulation}

Machine learning techniques show promise as a replacement for the aforementioned
DSP techniques for the purpose of low complexity, high performance coherent
optical receiver systems.

\par A K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classification can be used for the purposes of
removing noise from a signal. Using components of each symbol of the 16-QAM
output as features, and the groups of symbols as the classes, a model can be
trained .

\par Fuzzy c-Means clustering, a version of the k-Means algorithm, calculates
the probability that an incoming signal belongs to a cluster. This, when
combined with the KNN algorithm, has been shown through simulation to give
better performance than any of the previously discussed, more traditional DSP
techniques\cite{kMeans_2019}.
