\subsection{Modulation Techniques}

Currently there is a body of work being produced within the area of modulation
techniques for optical communications systems. One such technique, showing
promise in increasing spectral efficiency\cite{prob_2016}, while simultaneously
achieving lower optical signal to noise ratios (OSNR), and higher transmissions
distances\cite{400Gbps_2019}, is Probabilistic Shaping.
