\subsection{Neural Networks}

Neural networks have recently proposed as an alternative to traditional DSP
systems for low resolution analog to digital converters. This is due to the high
power consumption of high performance DSP systems within optical communication
receivers. A recent study has shown that a one-bit vertical resolution ADC, when
combined with a neural network, can recover a complex modulated
signal\cite{nn_2020}.

\par The purpose of this approach is to implement a binarized coherent optical
receiver to better utilise lower power ADC's. The binarized neural network can
allow for bitwise operations to be performed, rather than arithmetic operations,
which reduces overall memory usage\cite{nn_2020}.

\par The proposed solution in this study successfully (in simulation)
reconstructed a complex modulated signal in both a 50Gb/s SP-QPSK and 100Gb/s
PDM-QPSK system. The neural network allows for the use of lower cost ADCs, while
the reduction in memory usage and calculation complexity allows for an increase
in performance\cite{nn_2020}.
