\par Optical Communications systems have become more ubiquitous over the
past number of years, more recently being a choice for internet data traffic for
their high data transfer rates.

\par This review paper acts as an introduction to some of the basic concepts of
optical communications systems, while also introducing some cutting-edge,
state-of-the-art advances in optical communication system DSP techniques.

\par As an introduction, a brief description of the technology is given to
provide the reader with a basic understanding of the fundamental principles behind the
technology, the physics, and a generalised overview of a full optical
communications system.

\par Advanced DSP techniques such as probabilistic shaping, coherent digital
optical receiver systems, and machine learning noise removal and signal recovery
techniques will be discussed in detail, aiming to give insight into the current
state of advances in digital signal processing with regards to optical
communication systems.
