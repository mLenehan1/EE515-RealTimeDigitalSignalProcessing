It is clear that there has been much work done on modulation techniques, signal
recovery, and coherent detection within the last number of years. These
techniques have allowed for benefits such as offsetting noise introduced in
transmission, reducing system complexity, increasing transmission distances, and
increase in performance.

\par While newer machine learning techniques are promising increased
performance, on lower cost, lower power ADC's, there is still work being done on
increasing performance to the greatest extent possible using more traditional
DSP techniques, as with probabilistic shaping.

\par The aim of all of the techniques mentioned is to increase data rates and
throughput within optical communications systems in an effort to increase their
usage and ubiquity in worldwide communication systems.
