In order to understand the ``state of the art'' within the field of optical
communications systems with relation to digital signal processing, it is
necessary to have a level of understanding of its background. This section will
introduce the basic physics concepts, an generalised overview of a typical
optical communications system, along with the advantages an optical
communication system offers.
