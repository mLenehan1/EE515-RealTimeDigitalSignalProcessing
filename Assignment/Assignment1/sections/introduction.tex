Modern optical communications systems have been in use since the 1960's, with
the first commercial usage in 1977 in California, where telephone traffic was
transmit at a rate of 6Mbps\cite{alwayn_2004}. Since this time, systems have
been implemented to transmit data for applications such as telephony, cable
television, and internet data.
\par This literature review will present a history of the usage and
implementations of optical communications systems, and an overview of the
applications of the technology.
\par Following this, a review of the current ``state of the art'' within the
field, as it applies to digital signal processing, and the modulation algorithms
implemented, will be completed.
