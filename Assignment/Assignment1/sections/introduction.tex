Modern optical communications systems have been in use since the 1960's, with
the first commercial usage in 1977 in California, where telephone traffic was
transmit at a rate of 6Mbps\cite{alwayn_2004}. Since this time, systems have
been implemented to transmit data for applications such as telephony, cable
television, and internet data.

\par This literature review will present a history of the usage and
implementations of optical communications systems, and an overview of the
applications of the technology. As an introduction to this technology, a
comprehensive background will be given, explaining the physics behind optical
communications systems, an overview of an optical communications system, and
some of the advantages of the technology.

\par Following this, there is a review of the current ``state of the art'' within the
field, as it applies to digital signal processing, and the modulation algorithms
implemented. These advances in the field will be reviewed in terms of their
benefits to the technology as a whole.
