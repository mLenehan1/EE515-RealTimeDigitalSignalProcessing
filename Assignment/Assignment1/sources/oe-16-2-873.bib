abstract = {Continuous real-time measurements are shown from a coherent 40 Gb/s transmission system that uses Dual-Polarization Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (DP-QPSK) modulation. Digital compensation is used for dispersion and polarization effects, with little performance degradation created by 150 ps of rapidly varying 1st-order PMD.},
